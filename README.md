# CPSC-362-proj
Each iteration will be in its own branch

## Goals
 - Our overall goal is to get familiar with Unity3D and Github
 - Therefore, we will have a small amount of planned features
 - Features:
   - A map
   - Creeps that will follow a path
   - Towers that can be placed on the map and target creeps


## Important Folders
### Work Logs
Contains a brief description of the work each member has done.

### Class Meetings
Contains the agendas and notes for each in class meeting. 
This could technically be placed in documentation, but it is important enough to be placed in its own folder.

### Assets
Most of our actual work will be found in this folder. Subfolders will also have documentation on the actual scene itself.

### Others
Other folders are used by Unity3D.
We will likely not be opening these files at all.
