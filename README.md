This will probably be the most difficult iteration, we may not complete this in time, if so, we will extended it to iteration 3

## Important Folders
### Work Logs
Contains a brief description of the work each member has done.

### Class Meetings
Contains the agendas and notes for each in class meeting. 
This could technically be placed in documentation, but it is important enough to be placed in its own folder.

### Assets
Most of our actual work will be found in this folder. Subfolders will also have documentation on the actual scene itself.

### Others
Other folders are used by Unity3D.
We will likely not be opening these files at all.
