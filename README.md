# CPSC-362-proj


## Important Folders
### Documentation
Contains the work that each member has done. Does not contain documentation for the actual project. Probably should rename this folder

### Class Meetings
Contains the agendas and notes for each in class meeting. 
This could technically be placed in documentation, but it is important enough to be placed in its own folder.

### Assets
Most of our actual work will be found in this folder.

### Others
Other folders are used by Unity3D.
We will likely not be opening these files at all.
