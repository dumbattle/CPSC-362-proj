This folder contains the discussion agenda and meeting notes for each in class meetings on Wednesdays.

The agenda is a list of topics we need to discuss. 
It is mainly Austin's responsibility to create the agenda.
The agenda is not a comprehensive list of everything talked about in the meeting, new issues may be brought up.

Meeting notes are taken by a dedicated note taker.
