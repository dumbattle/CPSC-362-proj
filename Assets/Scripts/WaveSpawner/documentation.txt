WaveSpanwer : Monobehaviour

  - Wave spawers handles the spawning of waves


  ********************************   Public Members   ********************************
  Init(creep manager)
    - In order to spawn the waves, the creep manager is need, sine the CM is what spawn creeps
    - CM could be set in the inspector, but would require an additional step that might be forgotten
    - Must be called

  SetWave(wave num)
    - Call this function to set the current wave.
    - 0-based indexing ie. first wave => 0
    - failing to call this will result in nothing spawning

  SpawnUpdate()
    - Update function that should be called during gameplay
    - If SetWave is not called, this will do nothing
   
  spawningDone
    - Return true if all creeps have been spawned for this wave
    - Useful for:
        - Not ending wave prematurely
        - Stop calling SpawnUpdate for efficiency

  ********************************   Abstract Members   ********************************
  maxWave
    - returns the last wave that can be spawned
    - use to check for end of game
    - dependent on implementation

  GetWaveContents(wave num)
    - returns the creeps that will be spawned during the wave


WaveContents
    Base class for contents of a wave

    ********************************   Public Members   ********************************
    Next
        - returns the next creep to be spawn and the time it should be spawned after the previous spawn
           eg. A time of 1 means wait 1 second after the previous creep is spawned to spawn this one
    Reset
        - Clear all progress
        - Calling Next() after this should return the first creep
        - Can also be used to compute randomly generated waves
