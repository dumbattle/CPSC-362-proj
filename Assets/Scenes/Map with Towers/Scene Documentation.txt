The purpose of this scene was to introduce tower objects.

This scene was worked on by:
	- Elizabeth: created the scene, the towers, "TowerMovement" script, materials
	- Alejandro: worked on the line renderer component

The "Map with Towers" scene was created by duplicating the "MapTest" scene.
The scene is located within the "Scenes" folder, in a subfolder called "Map with Towers"

Changes between "Map with Towers" and "MapTest":
- renamed "New Sprite" object to "Enemy"
- renamed "unknown", the tile map image, to "Map Image"
- a new tag "Enemy" was created and given to "Enemy" objects

Game object additions to "Map with Towers":
- "Towers" object, which this is a parent
	"Tower(1)", "Tower(2)", and "Tower(3)" are its children

Additional information:
A folder called "Towers" was added to the "Assets" folder.
Contects of the "Towers" folder:
- a subfolder "Materials" that contains materials for the towers and for the line renderer
- a subfolder "Scripts" that contains a script called "Tower Movement"
- a subfolder "TowerTypes" that contains only one type of tower at the moment

Each of the three towers "Tower(1)", "Tower(2)", and "Tower(3)" are identical.
