Script: CameraSquarer
	Script that sets a cameras viewport to view a set shape in the scene as opposed to the shape of the screen.
	Must be attached to a gameobject that has a camera component

	Fields:
		camSize
			How much should be seen
			ie. => (5,5) means the camera will see a 5x5 area in the scene

		screenPos
			Because the shape of the camera is set in the inspector, it may not match the shape of the screen
			As a result, the viewport will be smaller than the screen
			This field sets the position of the viewport on the screen
			(0,0) => bottom left

		scale
			The size of the view port.
			1 => the view port will be as large as possibe while still being able to fit on screen.

Scene:
	Camera
		Demo Scene
		Because the map cam doesn't cover the whole screen, a second cam is needed
