    - set "Tower 1" field to "Towers->Tower1.1"
    - set "Tower 1 Button" to "Canvas->Tower1"
  - attached /Assets/Scripts/UI/Test/UITester.cs script
    - set "Field Tile" field to /Assets/Sprites/Tilemap/grass1

How to use:
- clicking the "Tower1" button allows the user to place a single tower
- to place a tower, the user clicks on a tile
  - if the tile is a valid tile for tower placement, a tower will be instantiated at that tile
  - if the tile is not valid, no tower will be placed
    - there is currently no indicator of whether a tile is valid or not
    - tiles are invalid if it is a "Path Tile" or a tile with a tower already on it
- clicking anywhere (regardless if a tower was placed or not) after clicking the "Tower1" button will
  result in the loss in ability to place towers until the "Tower1" button is clicked again
