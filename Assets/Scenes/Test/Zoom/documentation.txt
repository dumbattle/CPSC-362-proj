duplicated from Iteration2 scene

- old 'TestUI' script replaced with new UIManager classes 'TowerUIManager' and 'PlayPauseUIManager'
  - functionally the same as Iteration2
- added 'TouchUIManager' script
  - on PC, pan screen by clicking and dragging. Zoom by using the scroll wheel
  - on mobile, pan screen by touching and dragging. Zoom by pinching
  - currently, there's a bug where when you select a Tower button and try to pan after,
    a tower is placed
    - ideally, the user can pan without placing a tower
