__***UPDATE***__
All work logs will be kept in a single file.
This wwas requested by the professor.


This folder contains logs for all the work every one has done outside of class.
Each person gets there own folder, and will not touch anyone elses folder.

Each file should include:
   - Date (possible as file name)
   - What was done

If members work together, they should create a single file and place it in the "Group Works" folder.
They should also include in their own folder that they were a part of the meeting, but do not need to include details there.

Note:
  - This was created on 9/30/2020, so any work prior may not be documented properly.
